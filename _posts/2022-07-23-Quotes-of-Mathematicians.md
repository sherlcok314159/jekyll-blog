8. Perhaps I could best describe my experience of doing mathematics in terms of entering a dark mansion. You go into the first room and it's dark, completely dark. You stumble around, bumping into the furniture. Gradually, you learn where each piece of furniture. And finally, after six months or so, you find the light switch and turn it on.

17. When one does a theoretical calculation, there are two ways of doing it. Either one should have a clear physical model in mind or a rigorous mathematical basis. — Enrico Fermi
18. Let the formula guide your thinking. — Someone
19. A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems. — Alfréd Rényi
