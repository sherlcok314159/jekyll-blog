2. To not know maths is a severe limitation to understanding the world. — Richard Feynman
3. Problems worthy of attack prove their worth by fighting back. — Piet Hein
4. An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field. — Niels Bohr

9. Perhaps I could best describe my experience of doing mathematics in terms of entering a dark mansion. You go into the first room and it's dark, completely dark. You stumble around, bumping into the furniture. Gradually, you learn where each piece of furniture. And finally, after six months or so, you find the light switch and turn it on.
