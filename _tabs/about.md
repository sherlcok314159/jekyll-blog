# Hi!

> You can check my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lzesPd-s8qrcbt2-BnQnUtAMxc-4DK3O/view?usp=sharing).
{: .prompt-tip }

Here is Yunpeng Tai. I am a geek about mathematics, machine learning and NLP. 

I am a junior Computer Science student in Suzhou University of Science and Technology. I am focusing on the <b>Open-Domained QA, Machine Reading Comprehension</b> and the features of the Large Pre-trained Language Models. However, if time permitted, any interesting topic can be my research area.

Iâ€™m currently trying to get a PhD offer from ML or NLP. Therefore, I am going to use this academic blog to record my thoughts. Also, I have been trying really hard to make the knowledge easy to grasp. Possible visualization or examples can be used to explain some topic.

Please feel free to reach out to me. Any interesting topic is welcome. And you can add my <b>WeChat</b>: Yunpengtai. Also, [email](mailto:yunpengtai.typ@gmail.com) is also welcome.

<b>Just as Wayne Gretzky said, "I skate to where the puck is going to be not where it has been." The exciting future of NLP is coming!</b>
